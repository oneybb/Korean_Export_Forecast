# Korean_Export_Forecast


## Introduction
This project aims to develop a predictive model for forecasting South Korea's export volumes over a three-year horizon, utilizing a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques. The project's methodology integrates Exploratory Data Analysis, research-backed approaches, and advanced time series models with hyperparameter tuning to enhance forecast accuracy and robustness.

## Methodology
Data and Indicators
To model South Korea's exports, external economic indicators were included, including:

-Taiwanâ€™s Export Data: Often correlated with South Korea's export trends.

-Consumer Price Index (CPI): Reflects inflationary pressures which may influence export prices.

-Exchange Rates: Korean Won to Chinese Yuan (CNY) and US Dollar (USD) rates, which are crucial given South Korea's trade relationships.

## Statistical Models:
###SARIMA and ARIMAX: 
These models incorporate seasonal patterns and exogenous variables to account for time-dependent and external factors influencing exports.

###ML Models:
Random Forest and XGBoost: Used for capturing non-linear relationships and interactions between variables, providing robust time series forecasts.
